# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to determine the number of retiring employees per title in Pewlett Hackard. As well as, locate which employees qualify to join a mentorship program.

Using SQL, we created a Retirement Titles table that shows all the current employees who were born between 1952 to 1955. Using the Distinct On function, we were able to filter the table and show the most current title for each employee. Then, the Count On function was use to create a table that showed the amount of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

The second part of this project consisted of creating a Mentorship Eiligibility table, specifically for employees who were born on the year 1965.
